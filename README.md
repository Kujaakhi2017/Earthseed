# Earthseed
A sci-fi arduino game.

# Inspiration
We were inspired by the game Seedship and our for hardware technology. We had been planning this project for a few days and were not even sure if we would work on Earthseed until the first day of Hack Princeton.  
Try the original game: http://philome.la/johnayliff/seedship/play

# What it does
Earthseed simulates the mobile app Seedship through an arduino. The goal of the game is to pilot a spaceship filled with 1000 colonists into a habitable alien planet so that humanity can be saved. Since this hack focuses on the hardware, this creates a much more immersive experience, with flashing lights and selection menus that feel like you are actually controlling a spaceship.
# How we built it
We designed the game with a breadboard, Arduino, LCD screen, LED lights, buttons, and wires. On the software side we developed and tested code in C, and then sent it over github. Then Gilbert transformed the code into .ino files so that they could actually be tested within the Arduino. This was our workflow for much of the first day.

# Challenges we ran into
We found that the story we created at the start was too expansive for us to implement. We had to cut down on all the features that we didn't need and only focus on what was necessary. For example, we originally wanted to include a brief introduction to the plot before the game started, but we decided not to run with it since it would not be user friendly to read multiple sentences on a 2 x 16 LCD display. Our final design would include 5 LED lights, 4 buttons, and random events that flickered the lights to signify what was going on. We also wanted to print a case for the hardware to protect it but we did not find the correct material to 3D print what we wanted.
During our project presentation, our buttons would come off of the breadboard when we pressed them. We found this to be very annoying.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I (Freddy Haug) am personally very proud of our team. We all met on Saturday because I missed my Friday flight, which led my original random team to leave me, and Akash and Gilbert got ABANDONED by their first team too. I ran into Akash when looking for the Friend building and we all just started working on something.

I am proud of how we were all able to communicate and accomplish so much in a 30 hour period. Even though we could not print out the case, I think this project is very close to being finished and I haven't had so much fun working at a hackathon before this one.

# What we learned
We learned that breadboards and people can be very unreliable, but beautiful things are just around the corner when you keep your head up. Also, this was hardware hack was just awesome.

# What's next for Earthseed
Earthseed will have a case around it soon. I also think manipulating the lights when crazy random events come would be cool too. If a space ghost came to interact with the user, we could introduce this event by flickering all of the LED lights in a spooky fashion before the LCD screen starts displaying about the event.
